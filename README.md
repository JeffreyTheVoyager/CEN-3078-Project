## Severity

Work Done to Repo:

1. Multiple commit was done on the first day. First I initialize the git repo and made my first commit "first commit".
   After working, I started by add the UML of the project and how each class will have their own attributes and their
   relation with other classes. I started with added the saving and checking class and work on their methods.
2. This continues with changing the saving and checking class to become one class called balance. With the creation of
   the user class the balance would be the type of saving and checking variable. after that we redesign the UML and
   started working on the member class. This continue with moving and changing file name, and eventually settling with a
   File, Payment Account, User, Bank class.
